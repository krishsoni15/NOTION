# Logos Directory

This folder is for storing Notion logos and other logo images.

## Folder Structure

You can copy and paste your logo files directly into this folder:

```
public/images/logos/
├── notion-logo.png      (Main Notion logo)
├── notion-logo.svg      (SVG version if available)
└── [other-logo-files]   (Any other logos you want to store)
```

## Main Logo File

The main logo file should be named:
- `notion-logo.png` - Main logo file (recommended formats: PNG, SVG, or WebP)

## Recommended Specifications
- **Format**: PNG with transparency or SVG
- **Size**: 40x40px minimum (will be scaled as needed)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 1:1 (square) works best
- **Background**: Transparent preferred

## Supported Formats
- PNG (recommended)
- SVG (best for scalability)
- WebP (good compression)
- JPG (if no transparency needed)

## Usage
The logo will automatically be used in:
- Sidebar (desktop)
- Mobile sidebar
- Header (mobile view)

If the image file is not found, the system will fallback to displaying the letter "N" as a placeholder.

## Adding Logos

Simply copy and paste your logo files into this folder. The main logo should be named `notion-logo.png` (or `.svg`, `.webp`, etc.) to be automatically detected by the application.
